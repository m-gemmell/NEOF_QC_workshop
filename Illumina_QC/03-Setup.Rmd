knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/start.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

This tutorial will give hands on experience with quality control of genomic Illumina data.

We will look at a good quality dataset followed by a poorer quality data set for practice. Afterwards you will carry out some self directed Quality checking as an exercise.

However, prior to this we need to get our workshops data and setup our environment.

## Workshop data {#data}

Before we can carry on with the workshop you will need the workshop data.
First ensure you are in your home directory.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~
```

Now copy the specified folder to you home directory.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cp -r /pub39/tea/nsc006/NEOF/QC_workshop/ .
```

Before running any examples let us change directory to the Illumina Quality control directory.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd QC_workshop/Illumina_QC/
```

## Conda

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/conda.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

We need to activate the `illumina_qc` `conda` environment in your terminal so we have access to all the tools we need.
The first step is to use `chos 8` which is a custom command for our cluster.
It will Change the Unix OS form version 7 to version 8.
Version 7 (default in our cluster) is too old for some of the programs.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
chos 8
. useilluminaqc
```
