This tutorial will give hands on experience with quality control of genomic Illumina data.

We will look at a good quality dataset followed by a poorer quality data set for practice. Afterwards you will carry out some self directed Quality checking as an exercise.

However, prior to this we need to get our workshops data and setup our environment.

## Workshop data {#data}

Before we can carry on with the workshop you will need the workshop data.
First ensure you are in your home directory.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~
```

Now copy the specified folder to you home directory.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cp -r /pub14/tea/nsc206/NEOF/QC_workshop/ .
```

Before running any examples let us change directory to the Illumina Quality control directory.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd QC_workshop/Illumina_QC/
```

This book requires some packages.
Mamba forge was used to install them.
To learn more about Mamba-forge and how to create your own environment please see the [appendix](#mamba_install).

To set-up your environment for this book please run the following code (you must include the full stop and space at the front of the command).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
. useilluminaqc
```

You will have successfully activated the environment if you now see `(illumina_qc)` at the start of your command prompt. 
This indicates you are now in the mamba environment called `illumina_qc` created by the instructor.

If you are interested in the use script you can look at its contents.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
less /usr/local/bin/useilluminaqc
```

__Tip:__ press `q` to quit `less`.

For more about mamba and how to create your own `illumina_qc` environment please see the [appendix](#mamba_install)
