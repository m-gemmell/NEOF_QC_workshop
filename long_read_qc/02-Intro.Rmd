## The data

The data for today is in the \"QC_workshop\" directory that you copied into your home directory (\"~\") in the Illumina QC day.

Check you have the directory.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls ~
```

If you __do not__ have the \"QC_workshop\" directory, the command to copy it all to your home directory is below.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cp -r /pub14/tea/nsc206/NEOF/QC_workshop/ ~
```
